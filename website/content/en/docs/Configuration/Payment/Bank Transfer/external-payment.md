  How to send payment instructions manually, in case your processes do not match Alf.io's flow
---

If Alf.io's offline payment handling is not enough for your use case, for instance because you need to send a paper version of the invoice, you can enable this flag, and send the payment instructions manually. Here's how to do it.


## Select "Send payment instructions manually"

![Offline Payment Configuration](/img/configuration/payment/offline-deferred/001.png)

this option instructs Alf.io to not show payment instructions when the attendee register. Instead, the following page will be shown

![Reservation Confirmation](/img/configuration/payment/offline-deferred/002.png)

The organizer can then confirm / delete the payment from the relevant section of the backoffice. See [guide](../)
